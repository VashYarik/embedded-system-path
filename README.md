# Embedded Systems Learning Path

This repository documents my structured path into embedded systems and firmware engineering.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate:
- how I learn low-level systems
- how I debug hardware and firmware issues
- how my understanding of embedded concepts evolves over time

## Focus Areas
- C for embedded systems
- Microcontroller fundamentals
- ESP32 + ESP-IDF
- GPIO, timers, interrupts
- FreeRTOS basics
- Debugging and hardware bring-up

## Tooling
- ESP32
- ESP-IDF
- VS Code
- Git
- Logic analyzer / serial logs (where applicable)

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains:
- small focused experiments
- code
- a README explaining goals, problems, and takeaways

## Current Status
Actively learning and iterating. This repository is updated continuously.
